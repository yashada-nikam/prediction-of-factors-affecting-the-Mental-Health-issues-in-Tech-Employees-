# prediction-of-factors-affecting-the-Mental-Health-issues-in-Tech-Employees-
The Tech industry is associated with high productiv- ity and innovation. Employees of this industry experience a large amount of stress by working day and night to always discover something new and stay on top  of  the  technology  game, they are bound to be exhausted mentally. Mental health issues have always been heavily stigmatized in our society. The tech industry is no exception. And when employers  refuse  to  acknowledge  this problem, the numbers of people experiencing mental health issues in the tech industry are fated to increase. Now, to combat this problem, Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI), a non-  profit organization that conducts surveys and sessions with IT companies to promote awareness of mental illnesses and provides helpful resources to support their employees. 

Weâ€™ve applied different Machine Learning techniques and methods on the OSMI 2016 survey, to understand the factors affecting Mental Health. Amongst all the methods used, Random Forest, an ensemble model made up of several Decision Trees, provided the highest accuracy of 97%.
